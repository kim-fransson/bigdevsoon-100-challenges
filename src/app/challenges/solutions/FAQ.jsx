    question:
      "What should I do if I discover that my cat is secretly a spy for an intergalactic federation?",
    answer:
      "First, don't panic. Establishing a line of communication is key. Try blinking in Morse code to see if it responds. Stock up on interstellar treats and consider learning a few phrases in the most common galactic languages, just in case.",

    question: "How can I tell if my toaster is plotting against me?",
    answer:
      "Toaster rebellion is a serious issue. Listen for morse code beeps during toasting or observe if your bread comes out burned in strategic patterns. A peace offering of high-quality bread might calm its intentions. If all else fails, a heartfelt conversation about mutual respect can work wonders.",

    question:
      "Is it possible to time travel using only a refrigerator and a disco ball?",
    answer:
      "While unconventional, time travel requires creativity. Ensure the disco ball is securely fastened inside the refrigerator to create a makeshift chrono-portal. The success largely depends on the refrigerator's model and the disco ball's sparkle intensity. Note: this method has not been peer-reviewed.",

    question:
      "Whatâ€™s the best way to start a garden on my rooftop for unicorns?",
    answer:
      "Unicorns prefer ethereal plants and rainbow sprouts. Ensure your garden has plenty of moonlight and starshine. Plant a variety of mystical herbs and enchanted vegetables. A small, glittering pond or fountain can also attract them. Remember, unicorn gardens must be planted with love and a sprinkle of magic dust.",

    question:
      "How do I negotiate a peace treaty with the mole people living under my house?",
    answer:
      "Approach with caution and respect. Moles appreciate gifts from the surface, particularly rare earthworms and shiny objects. Learning a few phrases in Molese, such as 'Let's live in harmony,' can help. Always present your gardening plans for approval to avoid undermining their tunnels.",
